In insecure.js, the server directly sends user-entered text in the response. This means that the user can enter arbitrary HTML, including script tags, to the client. These scripts could execute anything. This is called a cross-site scripting attack.

In secure.js, the server first replaces any HTML tag characters with escape sequences so that literal HTML would not be sent back to the client, rendering any entered code useless.
